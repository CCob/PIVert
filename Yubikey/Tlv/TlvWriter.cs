        // TlvWriter to build one.

        // not make a nested class public, and CA1815 says a Struct must

        // The language specifies that a nested type can be public, it's just
        // recommended it not be done. In fact, .NET has documentation that

        // "Do not suppress a warning from this rule." However, the .NET
        // AsnWriter class suppresses the warning and the Tlv classes are
        // following the AsnWriter pattern.
        //
        // We are also suppressing CA1815, which demands that a struct override
        // the Equals method. Once again, the .NET AsnWriter class overrides
        // this warning, and we are following their pattern. In addition, the
        // .NET documentation does declare, "It is safe to suppress a warning
        // from this rule if instances of the value type will not be compared to
        // each other." The only use of this struct is to implement the Dispose
        // method and allow the using construction. Hence, there is no need to
        // compare instances. We could have made this a Class instead of a
        // Struct, but we are following the AsnWriter pattern.
