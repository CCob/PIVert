    /// During the course of operations, the SDK will need to perform
    /// cryptographic operations, such as random number generation, HMAC,
    /// Triple-DES encryption, and so on. Any SDK operation that needs crypto
    /// will get it from this class.
    /// <para>
    /// The properties in this class are delegates. They are functions that can
    /// build objects that will perform the required crypto. The reason these
    /// properties are methods that build objects, rather than objects
    /// themselves, is because the crypto classes implement <c>IDisposable</c>.
    /// In order to avoid the complex problem of ownership of an object that will
    /// be disposed once it goes out of scope, the SDK will create a new object
    /// each time one is needed. This new object will be in scope only for the
